# IoT Beehive System

This project is an IoT Beehive system that utilizes the ESP32-CAM micro-controller along with multiple sensors including temperature, humidity, sound, weight, and a camera. The data collected from these sensors is stored in a Firebase database.

The system also includes a web application built with React JS, which allows users to monitor and visualize the data collected from the beehive in real-time.

## Features

- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Cooling and heating system
- Video streaming functionality
- Dashboard with graphs and visual aids for data analysis
